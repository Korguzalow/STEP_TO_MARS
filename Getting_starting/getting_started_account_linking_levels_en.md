# Welcome to the Arcona Ecosystem!

Arcona is a metaverse where your actions and token holdings unlock new possibilities. To fully participate, you need to link your accounts and understand how user levels work. This is especially important for participating in future events, such as the **ARS Token Airdrop**.

## Key Ecosystem Elements:

*   **Arcona Portal:** Your main control center ([https://portal.arcona.io/](https://portal.arcona.io/)). Registration required.
*   **Eva Bot:** Your Telegram assistant (**@Arcona_Eva_Bot**) for interacting with the system.
*   **Tokens:**
    *   `$ARCONA`: The project's main token (exists on the Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) networks).
    *   **LP Tokens (Liquidity Provider Tokens):** Tokens you receive for providing liquidity to pairs with ARCONA on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Examples:
        *   `UNI-V2` (ETH): [Uniswap V2 ARCONA/ETH Pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3/ETH)
        *   `Cake-LP` (BSC): [PancakeSwap V2 ARCONA/WBNB Pool](https://pancakeswap.finance/v2/pair/0x2170Ed0880ac9A755fd29B2688956BD959F933F8/0x8fC4532bE3003fb5A3A2f9afc7e95b3bfbD5fAAb) (*Note: The link points to the WBNB pair, which is standard practice on BSC*)
*   **User Levels:** Your status within the ecosystem, determined by the number of tokens you hold.

## PART I: How to Connect Everything?

To ensure the system recognizes your tokens and assigns you a level, you need to link your Portal account, Telegram, and crypto wallet.

1.  **Register on the Portal:** Sign up on the Arcona Portal ([https://portal.arcona.io/](https://portal.arcona.io/)) using **Web 3.0 registration**. This means connecting your **crypto wallet** (e.g., Metamask) directly during registration or in your profile settings.
2.  **Launch Eva Bot:** Find the **@Arcona_Eva_Bot** in Telegram and start it (use the `/start` command).
3.  **Link Your Wallet to the Bot:** In Eva Bot, use the `/setwallet` command. The bot will ask you to provide the address of your **crypto wallet** â€“ the same one you connected to the Portal and where your `$ARCONA` or LP tokens are stored.

**Done!** Your Portal, Eva Bot, and wallet are now linked. The system can now see your tokens.

## PART II: User Levels and Token Holding

Your **User Level** directly depends on the number of tokens you *hold* in your linked wallet. The more tokens you hold, the higher your level.

### Why Do Levels Matter?

*   **Main Goal Now:** Levels are **critically important for participating in the ARS Token Airdrop**. The higher your level (meaning the more tokens you hold), the larger your potential share in the Airdrop could be.
*   **Other Benefits:** Higher levels can also grant access to other features, such as increased limits for exchanging in-game Silver (if you participate in this GameFi mechanic).

### Account Types and Holding Requirements:

The system offers two paths to increase your level, depending on the type of tokens you hold:

1.  **Basic Account:**
    *   **What to hold:** **`$ARCONA`** tokens (on either ETH or BSC network).
    *   **Who is it for:** Suitable for those who simply want to invest in the project's main token.

2.  **Premium Account:**
    *   **What to hold:** **LP Tokens** (Liquidity Provider Tokens) from pools with ARCONA:
        *   `UNI-V2` (ETH): Obtained by adding liquidity to the [Uniswap V2 ARCONA/ETH Pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3/ETH).
        *   `Cake-LP` (BSC): Obtained by adding liquidity to the [PancakeSwap V2 ARCONA/WBNB Pool](https://pancakeswap.finance/v2/pair/0x2170Ed0880ac9A755fd29B2688956BD959F933F8/0x8fC4532bE3003fb5A3A2f9afc7e95b3bfbD5fAAb). (*Note: The link points to the WBNB pair*)
    *   **Who is it for:** Suitable for users who support the token's liquidity on exchanges, which is often rewarded with a higher status or calculation efficiency for levels.

### How Levels Are Calculated and Maintained:

*   **Automatically:** Once your wallet is linked, the system periodically checks your `$ARCONA` or LP token balance and assigns the corresponding level.
*   **More Tokens = Higher Level:** To reach the next level, you need to increase the number of tokens you hold (`$ARCONA` or LP, depending on your chosen path).
*   **Important! Keep Your Tokens:** Tokens must **permanently reside** in your linked wallet. **If you withdraw tokens**, your level will **decrease** (e.g., by 1 level every 5 days). This encourages long-term holding.
*   **Check Your Status:** You can use the `/HOLD` command in the **@Arcona_Eva_Bot** to check your holding status.
