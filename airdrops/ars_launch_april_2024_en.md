## 🚀 20,000,000 ARS Airdrop: x10 Reward for Premium Holders! 🚀

Friends, the Martian Project is gaining momentum! To celebrate this milestone and reward our community – especially those supporting liquidity – we are announcing an airdrop of **20,000,000 ARS tokens** with a special bonus!

### What is ARS?

ARS is the key to new opportunities within the Arcona metaverse, the token of our Martian Project.

### Who Will Receive ARS Tokens?

The airdrop is for holders of:
*   **ARCONA** tokens (on the ETH network)
*   Liquidity tokens: **PancakeSwap (Cake-LP on BSC)** and **Uniswap (UNI-V2 on ETH)**

### How Will Your Reward Be Calculated?

Your reward amount depends on your **holding tier**, snapshotted on **April 12, 2024**. The tier system is similar to the one used for Silver exchange, but with a **major boost for Premium status!**

*   **Basic Status:** Determined by the amount of **ARCONA (ETH)**.
*   **Premium Status:** Determined by the amount of **LP tokens (Cake-LP BSC / UNI-V2 ETH)**.

🔥🔥 **Key Rule: Premium holders receive 10 times (x10) the reward of Basic holders at the same tier!** 🔥🔥

### ARS Reward Table (with x10 Bonus for LP):
