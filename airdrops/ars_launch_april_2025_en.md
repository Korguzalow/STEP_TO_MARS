## üöÄ Announcement: 20,000,000 ARS Airdrop for ARCONA and LP Holders! üöÄ

Friends, we are on the verge of launching the Martian Project! In honor of this significant event and as a token of gratitude to our loyal community, we are pleased to announce a special airdrop of **20,000,000 ARS tokens** on April 12, 2025!

### What is ARS?

ARS are the tokens of the new Martian Project, which will grant you access to unique opportunities in the expanding Arcona metaverse.

### Who will receive ARS tokens?

The airdrop is intended for active users and holders of:
*   **ARCONA** tokens (BSC and ETH)
*   Liquidity tokens: **PancakeSwap (Cake-LP on BSC)** and **Uniswap (UNI-V2 on ETH)**

### How will your reward be calculated?

Your holding level on **April 12, 2025,** determines your reward. We use 5 levels. The reward calculation is tied to the **estimated USD value of your holdings** at the snapshot time (based on rates: ARCONA ~$0.003, LP ~$50, ARS ~$0.10), although the value itself is omitted in the table below for brevity:

*   **Basic Status (ARCONA):** Your ARS reward is equivalent to **half (0.5x)** the USD value of the required ARCONA for the level.
*   **Premium Status (LP tokens):** Your ARS reward is equivalent to the **full (1.0x)** USD value of the required LP tokens for the level.

üî•üî• **Key Condition:** Receive a reward equivalent to 50% (Basic) or 100% (Premium) of the estimated value of your assets required for the level! üî•üî•

### ARS Rewards Table:

| Level | Requirement (Basic) | Reward ARS (Basic) | Requirement (Premium) | Reward ARS (Premium) |
| :---- | :------------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------------: | :-------------------: |
| **1** | **10,000 ARCONA**    |     **150 ARS**     |       **10 LP**        |     **5,000 ARS**     |
| **2** | **20,000 ARCONA**    |     **300 ARS**     |       **20 LP**        |    **10,000 ARS**     |
| **3** | **30,000 ARCONA**    |     **450 ARS**     |       **30 LP**        |    **15,000 ARS**     |
| **4** | **40,000 ARCONA**    |     **600 ARS**     |       **60 LP**        |    **30,000 ARS**     |
| **5** | **80,000 ARCONA**    |    **1,200 ARS**    |       **80 LP**        |    **40,000 ARS**     |

**Important:** You will receive the reward **only for the single, highest level you achieve**. Your status (Basic or Premium) is determined by the type of asset through which you qualify for the level. If you meet the requirements for both statuses at the same level, you will receive the **larger** (Premium) reward.

### How to participate and receive your ARS?
